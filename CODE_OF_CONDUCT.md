# Google Open Source Community Guidelines

At Google, we highly value the creativity and collaboration of open source contributors. We appreciate the diverse skills, experiences, cultures, and opinions that they bring to the projects and communities they participate in.

All Google open source projects and communities strive to be inclusive environments, where all individuals are treated with respect and dignity, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or any other personal characteristic.

While we value diverse opinions, we prioritize respectful behavior.

Respectful behavior includes:

- Being considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful.
- Avoiding demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, sexualized, or physically threatening behavior, speech, and imagery.
- Not engaging in unwanted physical contact.

Some Google open source projects [may adopt][] an explicit project code of conduct, which may have additional detailed expectations for participants. Most of those projects will use our [modified Contributor Covenant][].

## Resolving Conflicts Peacefully

We understand that not all conflicts are necessarily bad; healthy debate and disagreement often lead to positive outcomes. However, it is never acceptable to be disrespectful.

If you witness disrespectful behavior, we encourage you to address it directly with those involved. Many issues can be resolved quickly and amicably, empowering individuals to take control of the outcome of their disputes. If you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the behavior is threatening or harassing, please report it. We are committed to providing an environment where all participants feel welcome and safe.

## Reporting Issues

Some Google open source projects may have their own specific code of conduct. In such cases, a Google employee will be designated as the Project Steward, who will receive and handle reports of code of conduct violations. If a project does not have a designated Project Steward, you can report problems by emailing opensource@google.com.

We take every complaint seriously and will thoroughly investigate each one. While you may not receive a direct response, we will exercise discretion in determining how and when to follow up on reported incidents. Actions taken may range from no action to permanent expulsion from the project and project-sponsored spaces. Before any action is taken, we will notify the accused individual and provide them with an opportunity to discuss the matter. The identity of the reporter will be kept confidential in the details provided to the accused. In situations that may pose potential harm, such as ongoing harassment or threats to anyone's safety, we may take immediate action without prior notice.
